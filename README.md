# Loop Machine

https://daniellbar.github.io/loop-machine/

## Overview
This project was written in JS and React Hooks.
when it comes to component life cycle i am more familiar with classes and the life cycle methods but decided to go with
the more updates approch of hooks.
the project is responsive, i checked responsivness for GalaxyS5: 360 x 640 and iPhone6/7/8 plus:414 x 736.
i didnt use any external libraries, responsiveness is pure css code (sass).
i wanted to make the selected loops files a dropdown on phone but had no time.
in order to deploy react project on github.io i used gh-pages library.
i will remove it from the package.json so that you wont need to install it.

to run the project:
1) download
2) open terminal and run : npm i
3) run: npm start

Regarding the bonus:
i wanted to actually record all actions (not just audio)
and render it on screen along with the audio.
it works untill the last action which is not stopping and you will need to stop it yourself,
also after playing recored you will need to refresh the page in order to record again.
i know why it doesnt work proprely but had no time to fix it (this also has to do with me choosing to go with hooks)
